# Collaborative Filtering with Polars

In this project, we explore how to implement collaborative filtering using the Polars library. Collaborative filtering is a technique commonly used in recommendation systems to provide personalized recommendations to users based on their past behavior and preferences.

To get started, make sure you have Polars installed on your machine. You can install it by running the following command:

```
pip install polars
```

For the performance comparison, you also need pandas. You can install it by running:

```
pip install pandas
```

Once you have these packages installed, you can run the collaborative filtering code by executing the `polars_collaborative_filtering.ipynb` script. This script contains the implementation of the collaborative filtering algorithm using Polars.
